# Minesweeper Game in Perl

This is a simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game in Perl. I made this project as a way to help me learn perl.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
- git clone https://github.com/your_username/minesweeper-perl.git

2. **Run the Game**: Navigate to the cloned directory and run the Perl script:
- cd minesweeper-perl
- perl minesweeper.pl

3. **Choose Difficulty**: Select the difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) and enter the size of the game board when prompted.

4. **Game Commands**:
- `R row col`: Reveal a cell at the specified row and column.
- `F row col`: Place or remove a flag at the specified row and column.
- `Q`: Quit the game.

5. **Objective**: Clear the board without hitting any mines. Use flags to mark potential mine locations.

## Features

- Three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard.
- Adjustable board size based on user input.
- Randomized mine placement for replayability.
- Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.
